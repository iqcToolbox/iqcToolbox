Welcome to iqcToolbox's documentation!
======================================

iqcToolbox allows you to (1) model uncertain and nonlinear systems and (2) conduct worst-case analysis on them with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs).

IQCs are a powerful mechanism for characterizing uncertainties, nonlinearities, and disturbances. The intent of this toolbox is to both provide those capabilities to non-experts as well as provide a central repository for experts to contribute their recent results. For example, the library of available IQCs is vast in the literature, but iqcToolbox does not encode all those IQCs; the iqcToolbox is designed so that external contributors can easily encode their missing uncertainty class (or disturbance class, or analysis theorem, etc.) and improve access for fellow researchers and users.

Because of this dual-purpose, this documentation has a user-audience portion and a developer-audience portion.
